I don't have access to the original content of `src/components/roadmap/RoadmapExerciseModal.tsx` in the provided code snippets, so I can't replace any placeholders with actual code. The AI's response only mentioned this file hypothetically but didn't actually provide any code for it or indicate what changes should be made to it.

The actual fixes were made to these files:
1. `src/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Defining the toast types locally instead of importing them
2. `src/components/ui/use-toast.ts` - Ensuring proper exports
3. `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx` - No changes were needed here

Since I don't have the original `RoadmapExerciseModal.tsx` file content, I cannot provide the full code for it.
